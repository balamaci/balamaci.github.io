<h2 id="reactive-streams">Reactive Streams</h2>
<p>Reactive Streams is a programming concept for handling asynchronous data streams in a non-blocking manner while providing backpressure to stream publishers.
It has evolved into a <a href="https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm">specification</a> that is based on the concept of <strong>Publisher</strong>&lt;T&gt;** and **Subscriber<!-- raw HTML omitted -->**.
A **Publisher** is the source of events **T** in the stream, and a **Subscriber** is the consumer for those events.
A **Subscriber** subscribes to a **Publisher** by invoking a &ldquo;factory method&rdquo; :</p>
<pre><code>public interface Publisher&lt;T&gt; {
    public void subscribe(Subscriber&lt;? super T&gt; s);
}
</code></pre>
<p>When the Subscriber is ready to start handling events, it signals this via a request to the Publisher through <strong>Subscription</strong></p>
<pre><code>public interface Subscription {
    public void request(long n); //request n items
    public void cancel();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is an important thing to be aware of, that the <strong>Subscriber</strong> is signalling demand to the <strong>Publisher</strong> that is ready to receive X items from upstream.
After it finishes processing them, it might ask for another set or even more.
Now, some subscribers begin by requesting an infinite amount(you&rsquo;d see this a request(unbounded)) of items from the Publisher and this why it.</p>
<p>Upon receiving this signal, the Publisher begins to invoke <strong>Subscriber::onNext(T)</strong> for each event <strong>T</strong>.
This continues until either completion of the stream (<strong>Subscriber::onComplete()</strong>)
or an error occurs during processing (<strong>Subscriber::onError(Throwable)</strong>).</p>
<pre><code>public interface Subscriber&lt;T&gt; {
    //signals to the Publisher to start sending events
    public void onSubscribe(Subscription s);     
    
    public void onNext(T t);
    public void onError(Throwable t);
    public void onComplete();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Between the <strong>Subscriber</strong> and <strong>Publisher</strong> there normally are the <strong>Operators</strong> chains (<strong>.map()</strong>, <strong>.filter()</strong>).
Each <strong>Operator</strong> acts as a <strong>Subscriber</strong> to the previous <strong>Operator</strong> in the chain so forth until it reaches the actual <strong>Publisher</strong>.
The <strong>subscription</strong> and <strong>demand</strong> signals travels upstream back through each Operator in the chain to the original <strong>Publisher</strong>.
Each operator actually can change the amount requested from upstream according to his own logic - for ex. a default subscriber usually requests an unlimited
number of items, but as the request signal bubbles upstream to the Publisher each operator.</p>
<p>This is nicely explained by the &ldquo;Movers&rdquo; analogy that I found <a href="https://tomstechnicalblog.blogspot.ro/2015_10_01_archive.html">here</a>
<img src="images/movers.gif?raw=true" alt="">
This image is missing the request to send more items from the last mover after it receives items - lets assume that it initially, the last mover
requested for an unlimited number of items which travelled to the next guy till the one in the house and then the objects started flowing-</p>
<p>The real world is not ideal and something the Publisher might not always conform to demand from downstream</p>
<ul>
<li>events might get produced even if your subscriber whose role might be storing the events in a database is not able to keep up.-
The mechanisms of controlling this possible mismatch of demand and this is the subject of <strong>Backpressure</strong> and is it based on either dropping or buffering the events.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flux-and-mono">Flux and Mono</h2>
<p>Reactor provides two main types of publishers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flux</strong> publisher that emits 0..N elements, and then completes (successfully or with an error)</li>
<li><strong>Mono</strong> a specialized publisher that can contain only 0 or 1 events and then completes (successfully or with an error)
Can be useful to express in an API that a single/no value(just completion notification) value is expected.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="simple-operators-to-create-flux">Simple operators to create Flux</h3>
<pre><code>Flux&lt;Integer&gt; flux = Flux.just(1, 5, 10);
Flux&lt;Integer&gt; flux = Flux.range(1, 10);

Flux&lt;String&gt; flux = Flux.fromArray(new String[] {&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;black&quot;});
Flux&lt;String&gt; flux = Flux.fromIterable(List.of(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;));

/* from Java Stream */
Stream&lt;String&gt; stream = Stream.of(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;);
Flux&lt;String&gt; flux = Flux.fromStream(stream);
</code></pre>
<p>Streams that just complete without emitting a value are valid - useful for example to say that a DB update completed(or failed)-.</p>
<pre><code>Flux.empty(); / Mono.empty();
</code></pre>
<p>so are streams that just complete with an error</p>
<pre><code>Flux.error(new IllegalStateException()); / Mono.error(new IllegalStateException());
</code></pre>
<p>Code is available at <a href="https://github.com/balamaci/reactor-core-playground/blob/master/src/test/java/com/balamaci/reactor/Part01CreateFluxAndMono.java">Part01CreateFluxAndMono.java</a></p>
<h3 id="creating-your-own-flux">Creating your own Flux</h3>
<p>Using <strong>Flux.create</strong> to handle the actual emissions of events with the events like <strong>onNext</strong>, <strong>onCompleted</strong>, <strong>onError</strong></p>
<pre><code>        Flux&lt;Integer&gt; flux = Flux.create(subscriber -&gt; {
            log.info(&quot;Started emitting&quot;);

            log.info(&quot;Emitting 1st&quot;);
            subscriber.next(1);

            log.info(&quot;Emitting 2nd&quot;);
            subscriber.next(2);

            subscriber.complete();
        });


        Disposable cancelable =
                flux
                        .log()
                        .subscribe(
                                val -&gt; log.info(&quot;Subscriber received: {}&quot;, val),   //--&gt; onNext
                                err -&gt; log.error(&quot;Subscriber received error&quot;, err),//--&gt; onError
                                () -&gt; log.info(&quot;Subscriber got Completed event&quot;)   //--&gt; onComplete
                        );
</code></pre>
<p>When subscribing to the Flux with flux.subscribe(&hellip;) the lambda code inside <strong>create()</strong> gets executed.
Flux.subscribe(&hellip;) can take 3 handlers for each type of event - <strong>onNext, onError</strong> and <strong>onComplete</strong>.</p>
<p>We can get a more clear picture of what is happening by adding the <strong>log()</strong> operator:</p>
<pre><code>17:54:53:755 [main] INFO 1 - onSubscribe(FluxCreate.BufferAsyncSink)
17:54:53:757 [main] INFO 1 - request(unbounded)
17:54:53:759 [main]  - Started emitting
17:54:53:759 [main]  - Emitting 1st
17:54:53:760 [main] INFO 1 - onNext(1)
17:54:53:760 [main]  - Subscriber received: 1
17:54:53:760 [main]  - Emitting 2nd
17:54:53:761 [main] INFO 1 - onNext(2)
17:54:53:761 [main]  - Subscriber received: 2
17:54:53:762 [main] INFO 1 - onComplete()
17:54:53:762 [main]  - Subscriber got Completed event
</code></pre>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re also seeing the subscribe request being made and the request upstream signaling demand for an unlimited number of items to be published.
the <strong>request(unbounded)</strong> message.</p>
<h3 id="first-look-at-backpressure">First look at backpressure</h3>
<p>It is not obvious above, but we&rsquo;ve not been fair in our <strong>Publisher</strong>, we didn&rsquo;t care what the subscriber demand was, we just pushed on subscribing 2 items downstream.
If we look in our</p>
<h2 id="working-with-legacy-code---mono-from-future">Working with Legacy code - Mono from Future</h2>
<p>Lets imagine we want to incrementally make our legacy code more reactive.
We can create a stream from Future, making easier to switch from legacy code to reactive so that&rsquo;s it right?
Since <strong>CompletableFuture</strong> can only return a single result(<strong>future.get()</strong>), <strong>Mono</strong> is the returned type when converting
from a Future.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">    @Test
    public void fromFuture() {
        CompletableFuture&lt;String&gt; completableFuture = CompletableFuture.
                supplyAsync(() -&gt; { //starts a background thread the ForkJoin common pool
                    log.info(&quot;About to sleep and return a value&quot;);
                    Helpers.sleepMillis(100);
                    return &quot;red&quot;;
                });

        Mono&lt;String&gt; mono = Mono.fromFuture(completableFuture);
        mono
                .log()
                .subscribe(val -&gt; log.info(&quot;Subscriber received: {}&quot;, val));
    }
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>Mono.fromFuture</strong> does a <strong>subcriber.onNext(futureVal)</strong> followed by <strong>subscriber.onComplete()</strong> registered with <strong>completableFuture.whenComplete()</strong>
However if we ran this, we&rsquo;d not see anything being printed.</p>
<pre><code>21:45:35:321 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1]  - About to sleep and return a value
21:45:35:481 [main] INFO 1 - | onSubscribe([Fuseable] Operators.MonoSubscriber)
21:45:35:488 [main] INFO 1 - | request(unbounded)
21:45:35:824 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1] INFO 1 - | onNext(red)
21:45:35:825 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1]  - Subscriber received: red
21:45:35:826 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1] INFO 1 - | onComplete()
</code></pre>
<p>because when we invoked <strong>CompletableFuture.supplyAsync</strong> our work is started in a thread of
the Java&rsquo;s ForkJoin pool and so will be the call to <strong>subscriber.onNext</strong> and <strong>onComplete()</strong>.</p>
<p>Our <strong>Mono.subscribe()</strong> call is invoked on the main thread however and there is nothing preventing it from finishing before the one which generates the event.
We could, wait for the value to arrive onSubscribe using a CountdownLatch:</p>
<pre><code>        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
        Mono&lt;String&gt; mono = Mono.fromFuture(completableFuture);
        mono
                .log()
                .subscribe(val -&gt; {

<p>Reactor provides for us some helper methods already: <strong>mono.block()</strong> which blocks the current thread</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">        Mono&lt;String&gt; mono = Mono.fromFuture(completableFuture);
        mono
                .log()
                .subscribe(val -&gt; log.info(&quot;Subscriber received: {}&quot;, val));

        String val = mono.block(); //--block indefinitely until a onNext signal is received, this is a new Subscription than above
</code></pre>
<p>and <strong>flux.blockFirst()</strong> or <strong>flux.blockLast()</strong> if Flux instead of Mono(but we must understand those are a new Subscription).</p>
<p>Another thing to notice is the use of <strong>Thread.sleep()</strong> means that the async thread is blocked for some time. The point of using Reactor is that
we aim for using non-blocking code as much as possible, because it means a low number of threads and context switches which translates in optimal usage of resources.
We should confine blocking parts to special thread pools that don&rsquo;t starve the one used by non blocking code. However, for the sake of simplicity we&rsquo;ll see some examples using Thread.sleep(),
You might even want to know there is a tool specially created to root out blocking code like <a href="https://github.com/reactor/BlockHound">Blockhound</a>.</p>
<h3 id="flux-and-mono-are-lazy">Flux and Mono are lazy</h3>
<p>Flux and Mono are lazy, meaning that the code inside create() doesn&rsquo;t get executed without subscribing to the Flux.
So even if we sleep for a long time inside create() method(to simulate a costly operation),
without subscribing to this Publisher(Flux or Mono) the code is not executed and the method returns immediately.</p>
<pre><code>public void fluxIsLazy() {
    Flux&lt;Integer&gt; flux = Flux.create(subscriber -&gt; {
        log.info(&quot;Started emitting but sleeping for 5 secs&quot;); //this is not executed
        Helpers.sleepMillis(5000);
        subscriber.next(1);
    });
    log.info(&quot;Finished&quot;); 
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="multiple-subscriptions-to-the-same-flux">Multiple subscriptions to the same Flux</h3>
<p>When subscribing to a Flux, the <em>create()</em> method gets executed for each subscription. This means that the events
inside create are re-emitted to each subscriber.</p>
<p>So every subscriber will get the same events and will not lose any events - this is named a <strong>Cold Publisher&rsquo;</strong></p>
<pre><code>Flux&lt;Integer&gt; flux = Flux.create(subscriber -&gt; {
   log.info(&quot;Started emitting&quot;);

   log.info(&quot;Emitting 1st event&quot;);
   subscriber.next(1);

   log.info(&quot;Emitting 2nd event&quot;);
   subscriber.next(2);

   subscriber.onCompleted();
});

log.info(&quot;Subscribing 1st subscriber&quot;);
flux.subscribe(val -&gt; log.info(&quot;First Subscriber received: {}&quot;, val));

log.info(&quot;=======================&quot;);

log.info(&quot;Subscribing 2nd subscriber&quot;);
flux.subscribe(val -&gt; log.info(&quot;Second Subscriber received: {}&quot;, val));

<h3 id="checking-if-there-are-any-active-subscribers">Checking if there are any active subscribers</h3>
<p>Inside the create() method, we can check is there are still active subscribers to our Flux.
It&rsquo;s a way to prevent to do extra work(like for ex. querying a datasource for entries) if no one is listening
In the following example we&rsquo;d expect to have an infinite stream, but because we stop if there are no active subscribers we stop producing events.
The <strong>take()</strong> operator for ex. just unsubscribes(cancels subscription) from the Flux after it has received the specified amount of events.</p>
<pre><code>Flux&lt;Integer&gt; flux = Flux.create(subscriber -&gt; {

    int i = 1;
    while(true) {
        if(subscriber.isCancelled()) {
             break;
        }

        subscriber.onNext(i++);
    }
    //subscriber.completed(); too late to emit Complete event since subscriber already unsubscribed
});

flux
    .take(5) //unsubscribes after the 5th event
    .subscribe(val -&gt; log.info(&quot;Subscriber received: {}&quot;, val),
               err -&gt; log.error(&quot;Subscriber received error&quot;, err),
               () -&gt; log.info(&quot;Subscriber got Completed event&quot;) //The Complete event

<h2 id="simple-operators">Simple Operators</h2>
<h3 id="deeper-look-at-the-workings-of-operators">Deeper look at the workings of operators</h3>
<p>Between the source Flux Publisher and the Subscriber, there can be a wide range of operators and <strong>reactor</strong> provides
lots of operators to chose from. Probably you are already familiar with functional operations like <strong>filter</strong> and <strong>map</strong>.
so let&rsquo;s use them as example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Flux&lt;Integer&gt; stream = Flux.create(subscriber -&gt; {
        subscriber.onNext(1);
        subscriber.onNext(2);
        ....
        subscriber.onComplete();
    });
    .log()
    .map(val -&gt; val * 10)
    .filter(val -&gt; val &gt; 10)
    .subscribe(val -&gt; log.info(&quot;Received: {}&quot;, val));
</code></pre>
<p>outputs</p>
<pre><code>16:00:32:530 [main] INFO 1 - onSubscribe(FluxCreate.BufferAsyncSink)

</code></pre>
<p>When we call <em>Flux.create()</em> you might think that we&rsquo;re calling <strong>onNext(..)</strong>, <strong>onComplete(..)</strong> on the Subscriber at the end of the chain,
not the operators between them.</p>
<p>This is not true because <strong>the operators themselves are decorators for their source</strong> wrapping it with the operator behavior
like an onion&rsquo;s layers.
Above <strong>Flux.map()</strong> returns a new Flux instances that wraps the <strong>Flux.create</strong> one and so on.</p>
<p>When we call <strong>.subscribe()</strong> at the end of the chain, <strong>Subscription propagates through the layers back to the source,
each operator subscribing itself to it&rsquo;s wrapped source Flux and so on till the original source,
triggering it to start producing/emitting items</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Flux.create</strong> calls <strong>&mdash;&gt; mapOperator.onNext(val)</strong> does val = val * 10 <strong>&mdash;&gt; filterOperator.onNext(val)</strong> which if val &gt; 10 calls <strong>&mdash;&gt; subscriber.onNext(val)</strong>.</p>
<p>Said above that I found helpful, a nice analogy with a team of house movers, with every mover doing his thing(like boxing) before passing objects to the next in line
until it reaches the final subscriber(the truck, which <strong>onComplete</strong> drives off).</p>
<p><img src="images/movers.gif?raw=true" alt="Movers"></p>
<ul>
<li>Call to .subscribe() starts the subscription, and the <strong>subscribe</strong> event bubbles upstream triggering <em>onSubscribe</em> through the <em>log</em> operator.
The subscriber then requests an unlimited number of items, from upstream.</li>

<li>Element reaches <strong>.filter()</strong> and fails condition so is not sent next on to the <em>.map()</em>. However, it meant that there was demand for elements,

<p>Zip operator operates sort of like a zipper in the sense that it takes an event from one stream and waits
for an event from another other stream. Once an event for the other stream arrives, it uses the zip function
to merge the two events.</p>
<p>This is an useful scenario when for example you want to make requests to remote services in parallel and
wait for both responses before continuing. It also takes a function which will produce the combined result
of the zipped streams once each has emitted a value.</p>

<p>Zip operator besides the streams to zip, also takes as parameter a function which will produce the
combined result of the zipped streams once each stream emitted it&rsquo;s value</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Mono&lt;Boolean&gt; isUserBlockedStream = Mono.
                                     fromFuture(CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -&gt; {

</code></pre>
<p>Even if the &lsquo;isUserBlockedStream&rsquo; finishes after 200ms, &lsquo;userCreditScoreStream&rsquo; is slow at 2.3secs,
the &lsquo;zip&rsquo; method applies the combining function(new Pair(x,y)) after it received both values and passes it
to the subscriber.</p>
<p>Another good example of &lsquo;zip&rsquo; is to slow down a stream by another basically <strong>implementing a periodic emitter of events</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Flux&lt;String&gt; colors = Flux.just(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;);
Flux&lt;Long&gt; timer = Flux.interval(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

Flux&lt;String&gt; periodicEmitter = Flux.zip(colors, timer, (key, val) -&gt; key);
</code></pre>
<p>Since the zip operator needs a pair of events, the slow stream will work like a timer by periodically emitting
with zip setting the pace of emissions downstream every 2 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Zip is not limited to just two streams</strong>, it can merge 2,3,4,.. streams and wait for groups of 2,3,4 &lsquo;pairs&rsquo; of events which it combines with the zip function and sends downstream.</p>

<p>Even if the &lsquo;numbers&rsquo; streams should start early, the &lsquo;colors&rsquo; stream emits fully its events
before we see any &lsquo;numbers&rsquo;.
This is because &lsquo;numbers&rsquo; stream is subscribed only after the &lsquo;colors&rsquo; complete.

and the seconds stream is subscribed.</p>

and only the <strong>complete</strong> signal is triggering subscription of the next stream.

<p>notice the difference in time between the <em>&lsquo;Starting&rsquo;</em> message. The first stream still runs but there isn&rsquo;t any colors arriving at the subscription for the whole time,
then the stream completes, which triggers subscription on the second stream.</p>

<h2 id="hot-publishers">Hot Publishers</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen that with <em>&lsquo;cold publishers&rsquo;</em>, whenever a subscriber subscribes, each subscriber will get
its version of emitted values independently, the exact set of data indifferently when they subscribe.
But cold publishers only produce data when the subscribers subscribes, however there are cases where
the events happen independently of the consumers, regardless if someone is
listening or not, and we don&rsquo;t have control to request more. So you could say we have &lsquo;cold publishers&rsquo; for pull
scenarios and &lsquo;hot publishers&rsquo; which push.</p>
<h3 id="processors---act-as-both-publisher-and-subscriber">Processors - act as both Publisher and Subscriber</h3>
<p>Reactive streams specifications also mention the concept of <strong>Procesor</strong>s which act as both Publisher and Subscriber to help.
You can use the same operators and subscribe to them, but also implementing the 3 methods <strong>onNext, onError, onComplete</strong>,
meaning you can invoke <strong>processor.onNext(value)</strong> from different parts in the code,
which means that you publish events which the Subject will pass on to their subscribers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">DirectProcessor&lt;String&gt; hotSource = DirectProcessor.create();

Flux&lt;String&gt; hotFlux = hotSource.map(String::toUpperCase);
//can both subscribe
hotFlux.subscribe(it -&gt; log.info(&quot;Subscriber1 received:{}&quot;, it));

//but also can push some events to it 
hotSource.onNext(&quot;blue&quot;);
hotSource.onNext(&quot;green&quot;);
</code></pre>
<h3 id="directprocessor">DirectProcessor</h3>
<p>A simple Processor that keeps a list of subscribers and publishes events to all subscribers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">	@Override
	public void onNext(T t) {
		DirectInner&lt;T&gt;[] inners = subscribers;

		for (DirectInner&lt;T&gt; s : inners) {
			s.onNext(t);
		}
	}
</code></pre>
<p>Any late subscribers miss on previous events. Events must be published on the same Thread.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">DirectProcessor&lt;String&gt; hotSource = DirectProcessor.create();

Flux&lt;String&gt; hotFlux = hotSource.map(String::toUpperCase);

hotFlux.subscribe(it -&gt; log.info(&quot;Subscriber1 received:{}&quot;, it));

hotSource.onNext(&quot;blue&quot;);
hotSource.onNext(&quot;green&quot;);

log.info(&quot;*** Subscribing 2nd**&quot;);
hotFlux.subscribe(it -&gt; log.info(&quot;Subscriber2 received:{}&quot;, it));

hotSource.onNext(&quot;orange&quot;);
hotSource.onNext(&quot;purple&quot;);
hotSource.onComplete();
</code></pre>
<p>we can see how the late subscription did not receive the events that were published before its subscription - the blue, green</p>
<pre><code>11:15:51:882 [main] INFO  - Subscriber1 received:BLUE
11:15:51:884 [main] INFO  - Subscriber1 received:GREEN

</code></pre>
<h3 id="connectableflux-and-resource-sharing">ConnectableFlux and resource sharing</h3>
<p>There are cases when we want to share a single subscription between subscribers, meaning while the code that executes
on subscribing should be executed once, the events should be published to all subscribers.</p>
<p>For ex. when we want to share a connection between multiple subscriptions of the same Flux.
Using a plain Flux would just reexecute the code inside <em>.create()</em> and opening / closing a new connection for each
new subscriber when it subscribes / cancels its subscription.</p>
<p><strong>ConnectableFlux</strong> is a special kind of <strong>Publisher</strong>. No matter how many Subscribers subscribe to <strong>ConnectableFlux</strong>,
it opens just one subscription to the Observable from which it was created.</p>
<p>Anyone who subscribes to <strong>ConnectableFlux</strong> is placed in a set of Subscribers(it doesn&rsquo;t trigger
the <em>.create()</em> code a normal Flux would, when <em>.subscribe()</em> is called). A <strong>.connect()</strong> method is available for ConnectableObservable.
<strong>As long as connect() is not called, these Subscribers are put on hold, they never directly subscribe to upstream Observable</strong></p>
<h3 id="multicasting-to-all-connected-subscribers">Multicasting to all connected subscribers</h3>
<p>In some cases we&rsquo;d like to publish events to all subscribers.</p>
<p>For ex. a stream of stock exchange prices that changes frequently and websocket consumers that subscribe to them.
Those on fast connection can keep up and display all the price changes, while others on slow connections will lose some price updates.
The source is hot, the market prices will change(tick) regardless if subscribers can process them or not.
The <strong>share()</strong> operator returns a <strong>FluxPublish</strong> which keeps a list of its subscribers and a <strong>Queue</strong> to which it collects the pushed events(price ticks) from Publisher upstream to the downstream subscribers.</p>
<p>It then tries to drain this Queue by pulling the events from the queue and pushing to each downstream Subscriber but based on the minimum request .</p>
<p>The exact logic is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">//determine minimum request from downstream subscribers
long maxRequested = Long.MAX_VALUE;
for (PubSubInner&lt;T&gt; inner : a) {
	long r = inner.requested;
	if (r &gt;= 0L) {
		maxRequested = Math.min(maxRequested, r);
	}
}

while (count &lt; maxRequested ) {
	queueEvent = queue.poll();

    for (PubSubInner&lt;T&gt; inner : a) {
        inner.onNext(queueEvent);
    }
    count++;
}
</code></pre>
<p>So the fact that the draining of the queue and publishing to the downstream subscribers is dependent on the demand from subscribers,
so a slow subscriber, and we probably don&rsquo;t intend this.
In the following ex., the FAST subscriber completes close to the SLOW one, although we probably expected it to finish in 200 * 10 ms.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">        Flux&lt;Integer&gt; flux = Flux.range(0, 200)
                .delayElements(Duration.of(10, ChronoUnit.MILLIS))
                .share();

        Flux&lt;Integer&gt; events = flux
                .publishOn(Schedulers.elastic(), 2);

        events.subscribe((val) -&gt; log.info(&quot;FAST Subscriber received:{}&quot;, val));

        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
        CountingConsumer&lt;Integer&gt; countingConsumer = new CountingConsumer&lt;&gt;(&quot;SLOW Subscriber&quot;);

        Flux&lt;Integer&gt; delayedFlux = events.
                delayElements(Duration.of(100, ChronoUnit.MILLIS));
        delayedFlux
                .subscribe(countingConsumer, logErrorConsumer(latch), logCompleteMethod(latch));

        Helpers.wait(latch);
</code></pre>
<p>We can have as exercise to implement a correct solution, as its not a trivial task.</p>
<h2 id="flatmap-operator">Flatmap operator</h2>
<p>The flatMap operator is so important and has so many uses, it deserves its own category to explain it.</p>
<p>I like to think of it as a sort of <strong>fork-join</strong> operation because what flatMap does is it takes individual stream items
and maps each of them to an Flux(so it creates new Streams from each object) and then &lsquo;flattens&rsquo; the events from
these Streams back as coming from a single stream.</p>
<p>Why this looks like fork-join because for each element you can fork some jobs that keeps emitting results,
and these results are emitted back as elements to the subscribers downstream
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactor/projectreactor.io/master/src/main/static/assets/img/marble/flatmap.png" alt="flatmap"></p>
<p>Rules of thumb to consider before getting comfortable with flatMap:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you have an &lsquo;item&rsquo; and you&rsquo;ll get Flux&lt;X&gt;, instead of X, you need flatMap. Most common example is when you want
to make a remote call that returns an Observable. For ex if you have a stream of customerIds, and downstream you
want to work with actual Customer objects:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Flux&lt;Employee&gt; getEmployees(Integer departmentId) {..}
 ...

Flux&lt;Integer&gt; departmentIds = Flux.of(1,2,3,4);
Flux&lt;Employee&gt; employees = departmentIds
                                .flatMap(departmentId -&gt; getEmployees(departmentId));
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>When you have Flux&lt;Flux&lt;T&gt;&gt; you probably need flatMap.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use a simulated remote call that might return asynchronous as many events as the length of the color string</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">    private Flux&lt;String&gt; simulateRemoteOperation(String color) {
        if(&quot;black&quot;.equals(color)) {
            return Flux.error(new RuntimeException(&quot;Black is not a color&quot;));
        }

        return Flux.range(0, color.length())
                .map(it -&gt; color + it)
                .delayElements(Duration.of(200, ChronoUnit.MILLIS));
    }
</code></pre>
<p>If we have a stream of color names:</p>
<pre><code>Flux&lt;String&gt; colors = Flux.just(&quot;orange&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>to invoke the remote operation:</p>
<pre><code>Flux&lt;String&gt; colors = Flux.just(&quot;orange&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;)
         .flatMap(colorName -&gt; simulateRemoteOperation(colorName));

colors.subscribe(val -&gt; log.info(&quot;Subscriber received: {}&quot;, val));         
</code></pre>
<p>returns</p>
<pre><code>16:44:15 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange0
16:44:15 [Thread-2]- Subscriber received: green0

<p>Notice how the results are coming intertwined.
We&rsquo;ve first got <em>&lsquo;orange&rsquo;</em>, we&rsquo;re not getting <em>orange0</em>, <em>orange1</em>, <em>orange2</em>, <em>orange3</em>, <em>orange4</em>, <em>orange5</em></p>
<p>This is because <em>flatMap</em> actually subscribes to all it&rsquo;s inner Flux returned from <em>simulateRemoteOperation</em>.
You can specify the concurrency level of flatMap as a parameter. Meaning you can say how many of the substreams should be subscribed &ldquo;concurrently&rdquo; - aka before the <em>onComplete</em> event is triggered on the substreams.
By setting the concurrency to <strong>1</strong> we don&rsquo;t subscribe to other substreams until the current one finishes:</p>
<pre><code>Flux&lt;String&gt; colors = Flux.just(&quot;orange&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;)
                     .flatMap(val -&gt; simulateRemoteOperation(val), 1);

</code></pre>
<p>Notice now there is a sequence from each color before the next one appears</p>
<pre><code>17:15:24 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange0
17:15:24 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange1

<p>There is actually an operator which is basically this flatMap with 1 concurrency called <strong>concatMap</strong>.

                              .zipWith(timer, (val, timerVal) -&gt; val)

<h3 id="flatmap-can-override-error-and-complete-event">flatMap can override &lsquo;error&rsquo; and &lsquo;complete&rsquo; event</h3>
<p><strong>flatMap</strong> in it&rsquo;s most complex form allows to override the &lsquo;error&rsquo; and &lsquo;complete&rsquo; event not just the &lsquo;next&rsquo; event</p>
<p>Here we introduce another event on window stream completion</p>

<h3 id="schedulers">Schedulers</h3>
<p>Reactor provides some high level concepts for concurrent execution, like ExecutorService we&rsquo;re not dealing
with the low level constructs like creating the Threads ourselves. Instead we&rsquo;re using a <strong>Scheduler</strong> which create
Workers who are responsible for scheduling and running code. By default Reactor will not introduce concurrency
and will run the operations on the subscription thread(the one that calls flux.subscribe(&hellip;)).</p>
<p>There are two methods through which we can introduce Schedulers into our chain of operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>subscribeOn</strong> allows to specify which Scheduler invokes the code contained in the lambda code for Flux.create() -where the source runs
it&rsquo;s event producing code-.</li>
<li><strong>publishOn</strong> allows control to which Scheduler executes the code in the downstream operators</li>
</ul>
<p>Reactor provides some general use scheduler strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schedulers.parallel()</strong> - good for parallelization in general. It uses a fixed threadpool, so backlog can increase
if there is congestion.</li>
<li><strong>Schedulers.elastic()</strong> - scheduler that adjusts its capacity according to demand. Good for IO/blocking as it will
pool threads and keep increasing the size of the pool if current threads are in use. Threads are cleared after some time being idle.</li>
<li><strong>Schedulers.from(Executor)</strong> - custom ExecutorService</li>
<li><strong>Schedulers.single()</strong> - uses a single thread - equivalent of parallel(1)- should be good enough if the whole code is non blocking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although we said by default Reactor doesn&rsquo;t introduce concurrency, lots of operators involve waiting like <strong>delay</strong>,
<strong>interval</strong> need to run on a Scheduler, otherwise they would just block the subscribing thread.
By default <strong>Schedulers.timer()</strong> is used, but the Scheduler can be passed as a parameter.</p>

<h3 id="groupby">groupBy</h3>
<p>groupBy splits a stream into multiple streams(a stream of streams), by a grouping function which provides the key
for the grouping. These substreams are GroupedFlux which consists of the grouping key and a value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">//the stream of events is transformed into a stream of streams

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactor/projectreactor.io/master/src/main/static/assets/img/marble/groupby.png" alt="groupBy"></p>
<p>In the following example we use the identity function <em>.groupBy(val -&gt; val)</em> when generating the grouping keys
meaning that the keys are also the color values:</p>
<pre><code>Flux&lt;String&gt; colors = Flux.fromArray(new String[]{&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;,
                &quot;red&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;green&quot;});

<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>
<p>Exceptions are for exceptional situations.
The Reactive Streams specification says that exceptions are terminal operations.
That means in case an error reaches the Subscriber, after invoking the &lsquo;onError&rsquo; handler, it also unsubscribes:</p>
<pre><code>Flux&lt;String&gt; colors = Flux.just(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;)
       .map(color -&gt; {
              if (&quot;red&quot;.equals(color)) {
                        throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Encountered red&quot;);
              }
              return color + &quot;*&quot;;
       })
       .map(val -&gt; val + &quot;XXX&quot;);

colors.subscribe(
         val -&gt; log.info(&quot;Subscriber received: {}&quot;, val),
         exception -&gt; log.error(&quot;Subscriber received error '{}'&quot;, exception.getMessage()),
         () -&gt; log.info(&quot;Subscriber completed&quot;)
);
</code></pre>
<p>returns:</p>
<pre><code>23:30:17 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: green*XXX
23:30:17 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: blue*XXX
23:30:17 [main] ERROR - Subscriber received error 'Encountered red'
</code></pre>
<p>After the map() operator encounters an error, it triggers the error handler in the subscriber which also unsubscribes(cancels the subscription) from the stream,
therefore &lsquo;yellow&rsquo; is not even sent downstream.</p>
<p>However there are operators to deal with error flow control.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s introduce a more realcase scenario of a simulated remote request that might fail</p>
<pre><code>private Flux&lt;String&gt; simulateRemoteOperation(String color) {
    return Flux.&lt;String&gt;create(subscriber -&gt; {

<h3 id="retrywhen">retryWhen</h3>
<p>A more complex retry logic like implementing a backoff strategy in case of exception
This can be obtained with <strong>retryWhen</strong>(exceptionObservable -&gt; Observable)</p>
<p>retryWhen resubscribes when an event from an Observable is emitted. It receives as parameter an exception stream</p>
<p>we zip the exceptionsStream with a .range() stream to obtain the number of retries,
however we want to wait a little before retrying so in the zip function we return a delayed event - .timer()</p>
<p>The delay also needs to be subscribed to be effected so we also flatMap</p>

<h2 id="backpressure">Backpressure</h2>
<p>It can be the case of a slow consumer that cannot keep up with the producer that is producing too many events
that the subscriber cannot process.</p>
<p>Backpressure relates to a feedback mechanism through which the subscriber can signal to the producer how much data
it can consume.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm">reactive-streams</a> section above we saw that besides the onNext, onError and onComplete handlers, the Subscriber
has an <strong>onSubscribe(Subscription)</strong></p>
<pre><code>public interface Subscriber&lt;T&gt; {
    //signals to the Publisher to start sending events
    public void onSubscribe(Subscription s);     
    
    public void onNext(T t);
    public void onError(Throwable t);
    public void onComplete();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Subscription through which it can signal upstream it&rsquo;s ready to receive a number of items and after it
processes the items request another batch.</p>
<pre><code>public interface Subscription {
    public void request(long n); //request n items
    public void cancel();
}
</code></pre>
<p>So in theory the Subscriber can prevent being overloaded by requesting an initial number of items. The Publisher would
send those items downstream and not produce any more, until the Subscriber would request more. We say in theory because
until now we did not see a custom <strong>onSubscribe</strong> request being implemented. This is because if not specified explicitly,
there is a default implementation which requests of <strong>Integer.MAX_VALUE</strong> which basically means &ldquo;send all you have&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Neither did we see the code in the producer that takes consideration of the number of items requested by the subscriber.</p>
<pre><code>Flux.create(subscriber -&gt; {
      log.info(&quot;Started emitting&quot;);

      for(int i=0; i &lt; 300; i++) {
           if(subscriber.isCanceled()) {
              return;
           }
           log.info(&quot;Emitting {}&quot;, i);
           subscriber.next(i);
      }

      subscriber.complete();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like it&rsquo;s not possible to slow down production based on request(as there is no reference to the requested items),
we can at most stop production if the subscriber canceled subscription.</p>
<p>This can be done if we extend Flux/Mono so we can pass our custom Subscription type to the downstream subscriber:</p>
<pre><code>class CustomRangeFlux extends Flux&lt;Integer&gt; {
    private int startFrom;
    private int count;

    CustomRangeFlux(int startFrom, int count) {
        this.startFrom = startFrom;
        this.count = count;
    }

    @Override
    public void subscribe(Subscriber&lt;? super Integer&gt; subscriber) {
        subscriber.onSubscribe(
                    new CustomRangeSubscription(startFrom, count, subscriber));
    }
}

private class CustomRangeSubscription implements Subscription {

     volatile boolean cancelled;
     private int count;
     private int currentCount;
     private int startFrom;

     private Subscriber&lt;? super Integer&gt; actualSubscriber;

     CustomRangeSubscription(int startFrom, int count, 
                                    Subscriber&lt;? super Integer&gt; actualSubscriber) {
           this.count = count;
           this.startFrom = startFrom;
           this.actualSubscriber = actualSubscriber;
     }

     @Override
     public void request(long items) {
           for(int i=0; i &lt; items; i++) {
               if(cancelled) {
                    return;
               }

               if(currentCount == count) {
                    actualSubscriber.onComplete();
                    return;
               }

               actualSubscriber.onNext(startFrom + currentCount);

               currentCount++;
           }
     }

     @Override
     public void cancel() {
           cancelled = true;
     }
}
</code></pre>
<p>and using our custom Flux that knows to produce just as many items that the Subscriber <strong>requests</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>Flux&lt;Integer&gt; flux = new CustomFlux(5, 10)
                             .log();

//we request a limited number of items
flux.subscribe(val -&gt; log.info(&quot;Subscriber received: {}&quot;, val), 3);

</code></pre>
<p>So does it mean that streams created with <em>Flux.create()</em> are destined to failed for a slow subscriber?<br>
And what about hot publishers(that emit indifferent of any subscribers listening)?</p>
<p>If we look at the definition of <em>Flux.create()</em></p>
<pre><code>public static &lt;T&gt; Flux&lt;T&gt; create(Consumer&lt;? super FluxSink&lt;T&gt;&gt; emitter) {
	return create(emitter, OverflowStrategy.BUFFER);
}
</code></pre>
<p>there is this OverflowStrategy that specifies how to deal with too many events that overflow the consumers:</p>
<ul>
<li>OverflowStrategy.BUFFER buffer in memory the events that overflow. Of course is we don&rsquo;t drop over some threshold, it might lead to OufOfMemory.</li>
<li>OverflowStrategy.DROP just drop the overflowing events</li>
<li>OverflowStrategy.LATEST drop queued older events and keep more recent</li>
<li>OverflowStrategy.ERROR we get an error in the subscriber immediately</li>
</ul>
<p>Still what does it mean to &lsquo;overflow&rsquo; in the first place? It means to emit more items than requested downstream.
But we said that by default the subscriber requests Integer.MAX_VALUE, so unless we override the request number
it means it would never overflow. True, but between the Publisher and the Subscriber you&rsquo;d have a series of operators.
When we subscribe, a Subscriber travels up through all operators to the original Publisher and some operators override
the requested items. One such operator is <strong>publishOn</strong>() which makes it&rsquo;s own request to the upstream Publisher(256 by default),
but can take a parameter to specify the request size.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see:</p>
<pre><code>Flux&lt;Integer&gt; publisher = Flux.create(subscriber -&gt; {
      log.info(&quot;Started emitting&quot;);

      for(int i=0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
           log.info(&quot;Emitting {}&quot;, i);
           subscriber.next(i);
      }

      subscriber.complete();
}, OverflowStrategy.DROP);

publisher = publisher.log()
                     .publishOn(Schedulers.newElastic(&quot;elast&quot;), 5);


publisher.subscribe(val -&gt; {
                      log.info(&quot;Subscriber received: {}&quot;, val);
                      Helpers.sleepMillis(50); //slow down 
                  });

=======================

[elast-2] BaseTestFlux - Subscriber received: 4
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how the log show that the request to the source Flux.create(..) is for 5(as requested in <em>publishOn</em>),
not the Integer.MAX_VALUE(which is the default) and also that overflown events(produced over the 5 requested), were dropped as they were not received by the
onNext callback in the Subscriber.
You may think that publishOn was force put there just for the sake of showing an example of overriding number of requests in an operator,
but it&rsquo;s because we need <em>publishOn</em> to have the producer and consumer use different threads.
If both of them would have used the same thread, we could not have an overflow scenario where the producer is
emitting faster(since it has to wait for the subscriber).</p>
