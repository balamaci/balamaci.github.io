I'm a developer in love with Java and recenly Kotlin. 
I spent more than 15 years on backends and web frontends. Now I'm working at Deutschebank for low latency trading on Java platforms and micro-services using it, built mainly on Spring, some of which have been implemented with reactive, non-blocking approaches.

Currently trying out Rust as a way to go even more baremetal to lower the latency and resources.
